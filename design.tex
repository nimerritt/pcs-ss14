A Heresy network is consists of multiple individual dissent networks composed in a tree-structure. The leaves of the tree are users wishing to send messages anonymously. The users are parititoned into groups. Each group consists of a specific set of users, along with a set of dissent servers. Each group is a dissent network. In each round, users submit their ciphertexts and a usual dissent round is run in each group. At the end of a single round, one message is output from each group. We treat these as the ciphertexts for the next level in the heresy tree. This continues until one message reaches the root dissent group. At this point, the message is then multicast back down the tree and all users receive it. We refer to this as one complete hersey round.

Users onion-encrypt their messages such that at each level, one layer of encryption can be removed. This is done to acheive the desired anonymity goals of the system. As is the case with dissent, the final output need not be a plaintext message, but rather encrypted for a specific recipient.
